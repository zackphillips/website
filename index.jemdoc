== About me
With over a decade of experience as a seasoned computational sensing generalist, I have pioneered and scaled systems across diverse fields, including biometric sensing (Apple Exploratory Design), drug discovery ([http://www.insitro.com insitro]), and defense ([http://disp.duke.edu/ AWARE Project at Duke University]). My expertise lies in applying theoretical knowledge of computational optical physics and leveraging high-dimensional data models to derive actionable insights. I have also developed a robust software skill set and led numerous collaborative projects. In addition, I co-founded [http://sci-microscopy.com SCI Microscopy] with my PhD advisor, [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/waller.html Laura Waller], and earned my PhD in [https://grad.berkeley.edu/program/applied-science-tech/ Applied Science and Technology] from UC Berkeley’s [http://www.laurawaller.com Computational Imaging Lab] within the [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/ EECS Department].

I lead the Computational Microscopy Group at [http://www.insitro.com insitro], focusing on developing scalable, ML-ready datasets through optical microscopy to enhance drug discovery.

Colleagues often describe me as a "builder"—skilled in hardware, software, and ML. I thrive in small teams that tackle well-defined, challenging design problems requiring an interdisciplinary approach. While microscopy presents many such challenges, I also enjoy exploring similar problems in other imaging domains.

Before relocating to California from my home state of North Carolina, I worked as a lab technician in the [http://disp.duke.edu/ DISP Lab at Duke University]. I completed my BS with highest honors in Applied Science and Engineering (Biomedical Engineering concentration) at UNC-Chapel Hill, which is now the [https://www.bme.unc.edu UNC Biomedical Engineering Department].

Outside of research, I enjoy surfing, camping, woodworking, running, and wind sports. I was also involved in the [http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/seed/ Students for Environmental Energy Development (SEED)] program from 2014 to 2018, where I mentored 4th and 5th graders at La Esculeta Elementary in Oakland, CA.
