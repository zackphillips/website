== About me
Since July 2019 I've been member of the Exploratory Design Group at [https://www.apple.com Apple] working as a technical contributor on several exploratory projects. Prior to joining Apple I was a Ph.D. Candidate in the [http://www.laurawaller.com Waller Lab] at UC Berkeley, where I earned my Ph.D. in [http://ast.berkeley.edu Applied Science and Technology] in 2019. As part of the Waller Lab, I worked with fellow graduate students and collaborators to explore new and novel ways of designing imaging hardware and reconstruction algorithms together, optimizing for performance, robustness, and price. During this time I developed an interdisciplinary skill-set which spans large-scale computation, optical engineering, mechanical engineering, and circuit design. \n

Before moving to California, I spent a year as an Associate in Research in the [http://disp.duke.edu/ DISP Lab at Duke University] after completing my BS with highest honors from UNC-Chapel Hill in Applied Science and Engineering (with a BME concentration) - which is now the [https://www.bme.unc.edu UNC Biomedical Engineering Department]. Outside of research, I enjoy surfing, camping, woodworking, running, kitesurfing, and volunteering. From 2014 to 2018 I was part of the [http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/seed/ Students for Environmental Energy Development (SEED)] program, a weekly after-school program for 4th and 5th graders at La Esculeta Elementary in Oakland, CA.
