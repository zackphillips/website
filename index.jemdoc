== About me
I received the B.S. with Highest Honors in Applied Science and Engineering at UNC Chapel Hill in 2013. While at UNC, I was an undergraduate researcher in the [https://users.physics.unc.edu/~aold/people.htm Optical Coherence Imaging Lab]. I then spent a year as an Associate in Research in the [http://disp.duke.edu/ DISP Lab at Duke University]. Since 2014, I have been a graduate student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley, where I work with [http://www.laurawaller.com Associate Prof. Laura Waller]. I earned my M.S. in Applied Science and Technology from Berkeley in 2016. As part of Laura's group, I work with fellow graduate students and collaborators to explore new and novel ways of designing imaging hardware and reconstruction algorithms together, optimizing for performance, robustness, and price.\n

Outside of research, I enjoy surfing, camping, woodworking, running, kitesurfing, and volunteering. Since 2014 I have been a part of the [http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/seed/ Students for Environmental Energy Development (SEED)] program, a weekly after-school program for 4th and 5th graders at La Esculeta Elementary in Oakland, CA.
