== About Me
I’m a full-stack computational sensing engineer and technical leader with experience across biometric sensing ([https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-27/apple-makes-major-progress-on-no-prick-blood-glucose-tracking Apple XDG]), drug discovery ([http://insitro.com insitro]), and defense ([http://disp.duke.edu/ AWARE Project at Duke University]). I specialize in designing and deploying pragmatic, end-to-end sensing systems—from optics and electronics to software and machine learning—for decision-critical applications.

My work blends signal processing, optical physics, and computer vision with scalable infrastructure for data generation and analysis. I thrive in execution-focused R&D environments, and enjoy designing and building complex systems under real-world constraints. Over the past few years, I’ve grown into technical leadership and people management, where I focus on clarity, sustainable execution, and empowering teams to solve hard problems with creativity.

Currently, I lead the ML Imaging Team at insitro, where I oversee our imaging platform and develop high-throughput, ML-ready microscopy datasets to support early-stage drug discovery.

I earned my PhD in computational imaging at [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley], advised by [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/waller.html Laura Waller] in the [http://www.laurawaller.com Computational Imaging Lab]. I co-founded [http://sci-microscopy.com SCI Microscopy], a spin-out focused on open hardware for coded illumination. I completed my undergraduate work in biomedical engineering at [https://www.bme.unc.edu UNC-Chapel Hill] and worked at Duke's DISP Lab prior to grad school.

=== Outside of Work
When I’m not building things, I’m probably surfing, sailing, wingfoiling, or biking. I previously mentored 4th and 5th graders through the [http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/seed/ SEED environmental education program] in Oakland, CA (2014–2018).
