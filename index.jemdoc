== About me
I am a computational sensing specialist with experience spanning biometric sensing (Apple Exploratory Design), drug discovery ([http://www.insitro.com insitro]), and defense ([http://disp.duke.edu/ AWARE Project at Duke University]).
I earned my PhD in computational imaging from the [http://www.laurawaller.com Computational Imaging Lab], led by [https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/waller.html Laura Waller], within the [https://eecs.berkeley.edu/ EECS Department] at UC Berkeley. 

Through my career, I've anchored on two themes: anchoring on *outcomes* that further broader strategies, and developing skills for myself and those around around me.

Currently, I lead the Computational Microscopy Team at insitro, where I focus on developing scalable, ML-ready datasets through optical microscopy to enhance drug discovery. I also oversee insitroâ€™s imaging platform, coordinating company-wide microscopy efforts.
My PhD and master's degrees were granted by the [https://grad.berkeley.edu/program/applied-science-tech/ Applied Science and Technology] graduate group, a small and lightly structured doctoral program within the College of Engineering. 
While at Berkeley, I co-founded [http://sci-microscopy.com SCI Microscopy] with my PhD advisor. 
Prior to moving to California from my home state of North Carolina, I worked as a lab technician in the [http://disp.duke.edu/ DISP Lab at Duke University]. 
I completed my BS with highest honors in Applied Science and Engineering (Biomedical Engineering concentration) at UNC-Chapel Hill, which is now the [https://www.bme.unc.edu UNC Biomedical Engineering Department].

Outside of work, I enjoy surfing, sailing, wingfoiling, and biking. I participated in the [http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/seed/ Students for Environmental Energy Development (SEED)] program from 2014 to 2018, where I mentored 4th and 5th graders at La Escuelita Elementary in Oakland, CA.
