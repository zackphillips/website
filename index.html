<h2>About me</h2>
<p>Since September 2023 I've built and led the three-person Computational Microscopy Team at <a href="https://www.insitro.com" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>insitro</a> as the Associate Director, Computational Microscopy with in the Data Science / Machine Learning organization. My group enables high-quality microscopy dataset generation for our ML-enabeld drig discovery platform through both conventional and novel imaging modalities, including quantitative phase, functional (video) readouts, polarization, and live-cell phenotyping. I joined insitro in November 2021 as a Senior Machine Learning Scientist. From July 2019 - October 2021 I was member of the Exploratory Design Group (XDG) at <a href="https://www.apple.com" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Apple</a> working as a key technical contributor on several exploratory projects. Prior to joining Apple I was a Ph.D. Candidate in the <a href="http://www.laurawaller.com" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Waller Lab</a> at UC Berkeley, where I earned my Ph.D. in <a href="http://ast.berkeley.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Applied Science and Technology</a> in 2019. As part of the Waller Lab, I worked with fellow graduate students and collaborators to explore new and novel ways of designing imaging hardware and reconstruction algorithms together, optimizing for performance, robustness, and price. During this time I developed an interdisciplinary skill-set which spans large-scale computation, optical engineering, mechanical engineering, and circuit design. I recieved the AS&amp;T Excellenece in Research award in 2019, and was a recipient of the Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship in 2016.<br />
</p>
<p>While at Berkeley, I co-founded <a href="http://www.sci-microscopy.com" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>SCI Microscopy</a> to develop domed microscope illuminators for quantitative phase imaging, and other purposes. As of 2021, we've delivered over 40 devices to customers in over 7 countries. Our customers include major microscopy companies, small start-ups, national laboratories and standards institues. As CEO, I personally oversaw the design and prototyping of each device as well as the fulfillment of each order.
</p>
<p>Before moving to California, I spent a year as an Associate in Research in the <a href="http://disp.duke.edu/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>DISP Lab at Duke University</a> after completing my BS with highest honors from UNC-Chapel Hill in Applied Science and Engineering (with a Biomedical Engineering concentration) - which is now the <a href="https://www.bme.unc.edu" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>UNC Biomedical Engineering Department</a>. Outside of research, I enjoy surfing, camping, woodworking, running, kitesurfing, and volunteering. From 2014 to 2018 I was part of the <a href="http://berc.berkeley.edu/programs/seed/" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>Students for Environmental Energy Development (SEED)</a> program, a weekly after-school program for 4th and 5th graders at La Esculeta Elementary in Oakland, CA.
